Build local container.

Put Dockerfile any place then run (can take some time)

`docker build -t front .`

Put Project file into theme folder, rename it to Dockerfile and run there

`docker build -t pvcp .`

* pvcp - maybe any name(suggestion is project shortname)

Then add shell alias

`alias n='docker run --rm -it -v $(pwd):/work -w /work pvcp '`

Finally use for build

`cd your-theme-folder` && `n gulp`


* you can use simple compass aswell (n compass watch --poll). it will use gems from your theme folder.
